ðŸ’¡ Reflection ðŸ’¡

ðŸŸ I learned

How to:
-Link JavaScript file to html using the script tag  (<script src="index.js"></script>)

-Add the onclick event in html using "onclick="function()""

-Create variables using "let =  "

-Create functions using "function increment()"

-Call functions using console.log

-Strings and Numbers

-Incrementing and decrementing using JavaScript 
  - -= and +=

-DOM - Document Object Model - pull HTML elements into JavaScript to make them interactive
  - document.getElementById

-JavaScript is written in CamelCase with the first word being lowercase

ðŸŸ¢What went well

I previously learned some Python so I was familiar with Strings and Numbers. This went well.
Creating variables was an easy concept to grasp.
Camel Case is easy to pick up.
Incrementing and decrementing using the -= and += is understandable and I think I did well with it, it does need some more practice to stick though. 
Overall, I think this was something fun to create, though I'm still a bit confused. 

ðŸ”´What went poorly

The DOM is a bit confusing and I will need more practice. 
When creating functions I need to remember the parentheses, and calling the functions is a bit confusing, along with using them overall. This will require a lot more practice to understand thoroughly.
