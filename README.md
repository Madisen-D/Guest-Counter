ðŸ’¡ Reflection ðŸ’¡

ðŸŸ I learned

How to use display: flex, justify-content, and align-items
How to add hover effects using pseudo selectors
More about class, id, div, and span tags, and how they're referenced in the CSS
Importing fonts and using text files

ðŸŸ¢What went well

I'm very happy with the colors which I got from the Splatoon 3 pages and extracted using coolors.co
I'm very happy with how the Splatoon 3 fonts came out on the page and was very happy I could find them, here is the link for that: https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/13dstg3/i_extracted_the_fonts_from_splatoon_3_and_you_can/
I like the hover effects which added motion and context to the activities section.
Overall, I think this was something fun to create. I love the game and finding all the resources and making this was really fun.

ðŸ”´What went poorly

The website is completely unresponsive to screen size. Some parts are and some are not. That is my biggest issue. I want it to shrink without distortion and I couldn't figure out what element needed to be changed to do so. The width? a meta tag? I'm not sure, but I was missing something.
No other major issues, I'm happy with what it was for my first try.
